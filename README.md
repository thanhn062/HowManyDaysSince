In this fast-paced modern world, it's easy to get caught up in our busy lives and neglect the smaller tasks that are important for maintaining our health and well-being. Tasks such as changing bed sheets, checking car fluids, dusting rooms, and changing towels are often pushed aside but are crucial for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

To address this problem, I have created a solution called "How Many Days Since." This tool will help you keep track of these seemingly trivial but essential tasks.

With How Many Days Since, you can create a routine tracker by giving the task a title, setting the duration, and adding it to your list. At a glance, you can see which tasks need to be completed by checking the color and progress of the circular progress bar.

For those who use an iOS device, there is also an iOS version of the app, powered by Scriptable. This version provides notifications when the duration of your routine is running out, and allows you to display your routines on the iOS widget available on the Home Screen of your iPhone.
